Forza Racing Championship is the exclusive e-Sports competition of Turn 10 Studios, the Microsoft Xbox studio in charge of the Forza Motorsport franchise.

In 2019, our team had the task to give Forza Racing Championship an overall brand, broadcasting and visual refresh. We touched social media assets, provided visually appealing assets for our content creators on Twitch and the pleasure of spearheading the design for the event's Finals in partnership with Lamborghini.

My role revolved around overall exploration for brand and production polish alongside another team member. Duties included pre-press and prepping files to be received by external teams for print and event set up during a tight timeframe. I was also tasked with initial conceptualization for visual direction and design research in coordination with the lead designer for a fresh new look for competitive e-Sport racing.
